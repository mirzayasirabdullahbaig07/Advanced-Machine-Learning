# Challenges in Machine Learning

# 1. Data Collection
#    - Collecting sufficient and high-quality data is one of the biggest challenges.
#    - Data can be gathered from web scraping, APIs, sensors, or manual entry.

# 2. Insufficient Data / Labeled Data
#    - ML models perform best when trained on large, diverse datasets.
#    - Often labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

# 3. Non-Representative Data
#    - If the dataset does not represent the real-world scenario, the model will fail.
#    - Sampling Noise: Random errors or fluctuations while collecting data.
#    - Sampling Bias: Systematic error caused by an unrepresentative sample.

# 4. Poor Quality Data
#    - Data may contain errors, missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
#    - Such noise reduces the accuracy of ML models.

# 5. Irrelevant Features / Columns
#    - "Garbage in, garbage out": if features are irrelevant, the model will perform poorly.
#    - Feature engineering is crucial for success.

# 6. Overfitting
#    - The model learns training data too well (including noise).
#    - It performs poorly on unseen data because it memorizes rather than generalizes.

# 7. Underfitting
#    - The model is too simple to capture underlying patterns.
#    - Produces very simplistic predictions and poor accuracy.

# 8. Software Integration
#    - Integrating ML models into production systems and workflows is difficult.
#    - Requires compatibility with existing tools and pipelines.

# 9. Offline Learning & Deployment
#    - Models trained offline may fail to adapt to new real-time data.
#    - Continuous learning and retraining are often required.

# 10. Cost Involved
#    - High computational cost (hardware, cloud services).
#    - Cost of data collection, storage, labeling, and maintenance.
