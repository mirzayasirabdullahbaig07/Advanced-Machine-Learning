# ===========================================

# -------------------------------------------
# 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
# -------------------------------------------

# - AI = Artificial Intelligence
# - It is the broadest concept → The science of making machines
#   think, reason, and act like humans.
# - Focuses on "pattern recognition" and "decision-making".
# - AI is considered a subset of Human Intelligence.

# Old Approaches of AI:
#   - Symbolic AI (rule-based systems)
#   - Expert Systems (manually encoded knowledge)
#   Example: IF-ELSE rules for medical diagnosis or chess-playing engines.

# But rule-based AI was rigid → could not handle uncertainty or large data.
#    This gave rise to Machine Learning.


# -------------------------------------------
# 2. What is Machine Learning (ML)?
# -------------------------------------------

# - ML is a subset of AI.
# - It enables systems to "learn from data" rather than being explicitly programmed.
# - Importance: Instead of coding rules manually, ML learns patterns automatically.
#
# Example:
# - Symbolic Programming (old AI):
#   "If email contains 'offer' OR 'discount' → Spam"
# - Machine Learning:
#   Train a model on millions of spam & non-spam emails 
#   → learns spam patterns itself.

# ML is flexible, scalable, and improves as more data is provided.


# -------------------------------------------
# 3. What is Deep Learning (DL)?
# -------------------------------------------

# - DL is a subset of Machine Learning.
# - Based on "Artificial Neural Networks" (inspired by the human brain).
# - Power of Deep Learning:
#   - Works with raw, high-dimensional, unstructured data (images, audio, video).
#   - Automates feature extraction (no need for manual feature engineering).
#
# Why DL, if ML was working fine?
# - ML works well with structured/tabular data.
# - But ML struggles with huge, complex datasets like:
#   - Image recognition
#   - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#   - Speech recognition
# - DL solves this using multi-layered neural networks.


# -------------------------------------------
# 4. ML vs DL — Key Differences
# -------------------------------------------

# Machine Learning (ML):
# - Subset of AI
# - Works well with structured/tabular data
# - Requires manual feature extraction (feature engineering)
# - Training time: Fast (compared to DL)
# - Example: Spam email detection, Loan approval prediction

# Deep Learning (DL):
# - Subset of ML
# - Works well with unstructured data (images, text, audio, video)
# - Automatically extracts features from raw data
# - Training time: Slow, requires GPUs & large datasets
# - Example: Self-driving cars, Face recognition, ChatGPT

# ===========================================
# Summary
# ===========================================
# AI → Big umbrella (machines acting smart)
#    ↳ ML → Subset of AI (machines learning from data)
#        ↳ DL → Subset of ML (neural networks learning from massive data)
